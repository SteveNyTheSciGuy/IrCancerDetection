This uses an old metrics but the concept is there
Run fsmload6_14
then biomarkers_best_g5
the IR_Size--Takes a long time to run (10+min)

I looked at the histogram of each biomarker and selected regions populated by
the peaks.  Some metrics have 2 size metrics if they had 2 distanct bumps in
the histogrmam.
